    <li><i> Cream together oil and sugar and then blend with beaten eggs.<br> Making a homemade sponge cake was
        never so easy. Begin by mixing sugar and olive oil together.<br> Whisk well until light and fluffy with a
        manual whisker or a fork. Once done, add the beaten eggs<br> and blend well. Beat further so that the
         mixture turns white and creamy.</i></li>

      <li><i> Combine flour mix and beaten eggs.<br>Sift together the all-purpose flour and baking soda. It is done to evenly distribute the baking soda<br>
        in flour. Gradually, add this to the egg mixture. If required, add a little milk and mix till the<br>
        batter is fluffy and soft. You may not add the entire milk if you feel the consistency of your cake<br>
         is fine and it pours down like canned condensed milk. Add vanilla essence and blend well. Vanilla<br>
          essence is important to camouflage the smell of eggs and to make the cake taste delicious.</i></li>

          <br><li><i>Bake the cake as per your convenience.<br>Now, take a baking tin to cook the cake and grease it well
             using some olive oil or cooking spray. Then,<br> sprinkle some maida or all-purpose flour on it. It will prevent
             the cake from sticking to the base. You can<br> also line it with butter paper so that when the cake is baked,
              it can be taken out easily. Pour the prepared<br> cake batter into the prepared tin and place it on a stand in a
               pressure cooker. Do not add water to the<br> cooker and ensure that the tin does not touch the base of the cooker.
               You can also keep the baking dish on<br> an inverted steel plate. Increase the flame and pressure cook for two minutes.
                Now, remove the whistle and<br> cook on low flame for 35-40 minutes. If you are using an electric oven, cook at 180
                 degrees for 30-35 minutes.</i></li>

          <li><i> Check with a knife or skewer if it is cooked and serve.<br>Insert a knife or a metal skewer into the cake and if it
             comes out clean, then the cake is ready. Remove from the<br> oven/cooker and allow to cool on a wire rack. This cooling
              process is done so that the cake doesn't break down in<br> between and comes out nice and clean. Once cooled enough, turn
               the cake tin upside down to remove the cake.<br> You can also use the butter paper to lift off the cake, but you have to be a
                pro to make it happen quickly as it can<br> also break the cake. So, it's better to turn the tin upside down for a better cake.
                 Before decorating, cut an even slice<br> of the ake from the top to prevent any doomed top. But make sure you do this step when
                  the cake is still warm and<br> not completely cold. Now, take some whipping cream and line the cake with it evenly and scrape any
                   extra cream.<br> Once done, you can use cherries to decorate the cake or even tutti-frutti, it completely depends on your choice.
                    The<br> cake is ready now.<i></i></li>

          <li><i>How to make whipping cream.<br>To make whipping cream for a cake at home, all you need is a mixing bowl, some heavy whipping cream,
             powdered sugar,<br> vanilla extract and an electric mixer. Take the bowl and add heavy whipping cream in it along with powdered sugar and<br>
              vanilla extract in it. Whip them all together at medium-high speed. One must understand here that it should not be overdone.<br> If the cream
               comes out grainy and curdled, it's a hint that you have over-whipped the cream. The soft whipping cream will be<br> done in a few minutes, say
                about 2-3 minutes. Make sure to stop in between and check the consistency of the whipping cream.<br> The perfect whipping cream will have a
                sturdy peak in it when lifted off. It should not be too soft or liquidy, and curdled or<br> heavy. Once done, you can transfer in a cone as well
                 to decorate your cake.</i></li>

    <p><b>Tips</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>For making Homemade Cake, make sure you whisk the cake mix well. And better use an electric blender for mixing all the<br> ingredients, as this will
                     make the mixture frothy and light.</li>
                <li>If you do not have olive oil at home, you can even use butter or ghee. Or you can use homemade white butter for extra flavour.</li>
            </ul>
